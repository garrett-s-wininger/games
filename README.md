# Game Development

This repository is for experiments, prototypes, and submissions to Game Jams which I participated in.
It should be expected that these projects are in a fairly rough state with different levels of
playability. When appropraite, games with more investment (if any) will be moved out into their own
repository for further development and refinement.

## Structure

Individual games/prototypes live within their own folders under `Jams` or `Personal`. Codebases in
`Jams` are those which were developed over the course of participating in a Game Jame whereas those
under `Personal` are just as it says: my own prototypes or experiments to test out ideas for gameplay,
use of engine features, etc. At the lowest level within the individual game folders, there should be
instructions on how to load up the engine/game for development or playtesting. 

In most cases, jam submissions are likely to have an increased level of supporting documentation
depending on the exact requirements and/or duration of the Jam.
